# Hugo Mock Landing Page

**Created By: Praise Ndlovu**

## Summary

Hugo Mock Landing Page is a landing page built using Hugo's static site generator from a Bootstrap template. While this might seem straightforward, the real challenge—and fun—came from having to quickly familiarize myself with a new codebase. With only a few hours to implement meaningful changes, I had to rapidly adapt and make informed decisions.
